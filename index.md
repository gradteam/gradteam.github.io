## Mask and Social Distance Detection Using Computer Vision

PANDETECT is an application that will detect whether people in a particular area obey social distance rules and whether they wear masks or not. The main goal of this application is to identify places that do not comply with pandemic rules such as restaurants, workplaces and public areas. In this way, it is aimed to increase the control in the places where do not comply with the rules. In addition, this information will be shared on a map in the mobile application using the data of the places where rules are followed and not followed. That way, people can choose not to go to areas where the rules are not followed according to the map provided.
